TT:A powerful earthquake has hit the island of Namila, followed by a devastating tidal wave. Many of the island's coastal towns have been affected. Alerted by the National Civil Protection (NCP) system, you and the members of your University SAR UAV team prepare to leave for the closest disaster site. When you arrive there a short while later, you find a morass of broken buildings, piled cars, and splintered debris. Where once were streets, houses and squares, now lie water-inundated lagoons filled with hazardous material. Mobility is extremely limited. Conditions are harsh; it is cold, and you only have a few hours of light left. There is rubble everywhere, walking will be a challenge. You pull up your truck to a roadblock of over-turned cars. Other search teams have already arrived; they tell you that large numbers of victims are trapped in some of the buildings surrounding the main town square. While most of your team are gearing up and preparing equipment, you and two other researchers/operators start pulling your small quadcopter UAVs out from the back of your truck. The UAVs can fly up to one hour and survey as many as four square kilometers per trip. You plan to use them to scan busted buildings and piles of rubble with visible light, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral sensors. The UAVs will then relay those data and images to the NCP monitoring center, so response teams can pinpoint, then rush to save, anyone in need. This is just the second time you have been directly contacted by the NCP. You expect to provide precious support but know that the system still has usability problems. You are also aware of another issue, something that has been bothering since you first realized it. Where you locate your base station and how you plan the UAVs' paths will determine the kind of people the UAVs will be able to help. Now, for instance, your base will be right next to the main square in the center of the town; you are not sure, but you suppose that must be one of Namila's wealthiest neighborhoods. It is also where most of the University buildings are, so the UAVs' planned paths will probably run through areas biased towards richer, younger populations compared to the rest of the city.  Statistically, these are not the people whose livelihoods will be most at risk. You had put off thinking about it but have a couple of potential solutions in mind. Clearly this is not the time to implement anything, but the issue will no doubt come up and needs to be dealt with at some point.

TT:You will have to think carefully about how to allocate your UAV pilots. Tackling the issue from the planning side would require having and analyzing information about the distribution of specific population features at the disaster site well in advance. You are concerned this would be complicated and could delay UAV deployment.

TT:You set the question aside for the time being, and as you stand next to your truck, an NCP car pulls up. A woman steps out, she is the town Mayor. She walks towards a group of local officials and starts discussing how to coordinate the rescue efforts. Suddenly a man arrives, shouting that the school is full of children; apparently about sixty kids and three teachers are trapped underneath what is left of an auditorium nearby.  You try to get the Mayor's attention to discuss deploying the UAVs. You were introduced to her at meetings organized by the NCP and are almost sure she has recognized you. When you finally catch her eye, she nods and signals she has no time right now. As she continues talking to the local officials, you consider what to do.  The truth of the matter is, at those meetings, when you were asked to present the UAVs and explain what kind of help they can offer, you were met with quite a bit of skepticism. You don't totally understand why the Mayors and SAR specialists there were so resistant, given the obvious advantages of being able to use the UAVs in hazardous environments. Ultimately, an agreement was reached between your University and the NCP regarding your team's role within future SAR operations, but it was never really clarified at what point during operations you would need the local authorities' authorization to proceed with your missions.

TT:The deployment proceeds smoothly and soon the UAVs are aloft. You and your team have been training for months and this is the first opportunity you have to finally use the UAVs in a real-life disaster situation. Although you are confident that the data the UAVs are already collecting will prove precious, you are aware that if anything goes wrong there will be significant push-back.  At the national level, the SAR community has been hesitant about adopting new technologies, sometimes owing to negative experiences when collaborating with amateur UAV operators and due to the sometimes erratic, unpredictable behavior of the UAVs themselves. Your reputation as an UAV expert and, to some extent, the future of UAVs in SAR in your country for the foreseeable future are on the line today.

TT:As you are mulling over these thoughts, and anticipating what needs to be done when the data stream from the drones starts arriving, one of the most senior members of your team interrupts you to tell you that a rotor blade has been broken in a collision. These accidents typically occur with sloppy landings and is something you and the team have been working on but haven't entirely been able to solve. They are probably caused by issues with usability and cognitive workload. Although the flights are usually of the order of 5 minutes long, you know your pilots are under great stress and this kind of event is associated with the strain and fatigue that ensue.  The question now is, is there anyone else who ought to be informed of the accident?

You decide to approach the Mayor as soon as the situation allows to see if you can make yourself and your team helpful. When you finally have the chance to talk to her, you explain your thinking to her. She is still annoyed and, you suspect, briefly considers whether she should be trusting you at all. But the UAVs can provide real support to the operations and the situation is such that all help available must be used. Shaking her head, wondering at her own decision, she tells you to go ahead and deploy your remaining UAVs without wasting any time; as she walk away she warns you that she wants to be updated regularly and that she will not tolerate any further lack of communication.

You are not looking forward to informing the Mayor and local NCP officials of the accident and expect that they will greet the news with annoyance. When you finally manage to get a hold of them, you convey the news, trying to explain how this kind of event is to be expected and does not interfere with the overall usefulness of your team's work.  Surprisingly, both the Mayor and the NCP officials take the news in stride and seem to understand the situation. As you walk away, you have mixed feelings.
