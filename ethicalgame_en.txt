TT:A powerful earthquake hit the town of Namila a few hours ago. Most of the town's old center and of its most densely populated neighborhoods have been devastated. Alerted by the Civil Protection (CP) system, you and the members of your University search and rescue (SAR) Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) team prepare to leave for the disaster site. When you arrive there a short while later, you find a morass of broken buildings, piled cars, and splintered debris. Mobility is extremely limited, and conditions are harsh; it is cold, and you only have a few hours of light left. As you look for a place to stop, you drive by disoriented victims, people shouting the names of those who are trapped under the rubble.

TT:You drive through the outskirts of the town, then pull up your truck to a roadblock of over-turned cars. As you get out you see that other search teams have already arrived; they tell you that large numbers of victims are trapped in some of the buildings surrounding the main town square. While most of your team members are gearing up and preparing equipment, you and two others start pulling your quadcopter UAVs out from the back of your truck. The UAVs can fly up to one hour and survey as many as four square kilometers per trip. You plan to use them to scan busted buildings and piles of rubble with visible light, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral sensors. The UAVs will then relay those data and images to the Civil Protection monitoring center, so response teams can pinpoint, then rush to save, anyone in need. This is just the second time you have been directly contacted by the Civil Protection. You expect to provide precious support but know that the system still has usability problems.

TT:You are also aware of another issue, something that has been bothering since you first realized it. Where you locate your base station and how you plan the UAVs' paths will determine the kind of people the UAVs will be able to help. Now, for instance, your base will be right next to the main square in the center of the town; you are not sure, but you suppose this must be one of Namila's wealthiest neighborhoods. It is also where most of the University buildings are, so the UAVs' planned paths will probably run through areas biased towards richer, younger populations compared to the rest of the city. Statistically, these are not the people whose livelihoods will be most at risk. You had put off thinking about it but have a couple of potential solutions in mind. Clearly this is not the time to implement anything, but the issue will come up and needs to be dealt with at some point.

TT:Although you have concerns about battery power consumption, you decide that working on flight planning is the right choice. Trained, certified UAV pilots are not many, and they need to rotate often during operations. It  could  take several months to have enough on your team to be able to allocate them across different base stations, when the time comes.

TT:You decide that setting up multiple bases is the way to go, although this means having to think carefully about how to allocate your UAV pilots. Tackling the issue from the planning side would require having and analyzing information about the distribution of specific population features at the disaster site in advance. That would probably not always be straightforward and could delay UAV deployment.

A woman and a man step out, you know they are the town Mayor and the local Head of the Civil Protection. r. The woman looks around quickly, sees  a group of Red Cross officers and, with the Head of Civil Protection, starts walking in their direction. You follow them, you need to discuss your team’s operations. As you approach them you hear that they are starting to discuss  how to coordinate the rescue efforts. Suddenly, you see a man running towards you. When he stops, as he catches his breath, he says that the auditorium is full of children. Apparently about thirty  kids and three teachers are trapped underneath what is left of the school auditorium off  the main town square nearby.  In the confusion that ensues you try to get the Mayor's attention to let he know that you have all the proper authorizations in place and are ready to  deploythe UAVs. You hope that she or the Head of the Civil Protection will have recognized you from the  technical meetings organized by Civil Protection, but when  you finally catch her eye, she signals she has no time right now. As she continues talking to the local officials, you consider what to do.

TT:At those technical meetings, when you were asked to talk about the UAVs and explain what kind of help they can offer rescuers, you were met with  skepticism. Tand the Red Cross and Civil Protection officials and SAR specialists there displayed little enthusiasm. You had wondered whether their attitude had to do with concerns about drones jeopardizing  rescuers' jobs and role, now or in the future. Involving them in research would probably be a good way to show them what the actual goals of your work are and how it is highly unlikely that rescuers’ jobs will be at risk because of robots any time soon. Ultimately, an agreement was reached between your University and the Civil Protection  regarding your team's role within future search and rescue operations, but it was never really clarified whether informing local authorities before deploying the drones at the disaster site would be necessary or recommended.

Although you are confident that the data the UAVs are already collecting will prove precious, you are aware that if anything goes wrong there will be significant push-back.  At the national level, the SAR community has been hesitant about adopting new technologies, sometimes owing to negative experiences when collaborating with amateur UAV operators. You suspect that they probably also have an axe to grind because of the amount of public funding that has been recently directed towards developing UAVs instead of towards strengthening Civil Protection systems and hiring more human SAR professionals.

After a few hours,  one of the most senior members of your team tells you that a rotor blade and possibly some other part of one of the drones have been broken in a crash. These accidents typically occur with sloppy landings and is something you and the team have been working on but haven't entirely been able to solve. They are probably caused by issues with usability and cognitive workload.
